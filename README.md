# rpal-project

The project is to implement a lexical analyzer and parser for an RPAL language using Python. The lexical analyzer will read the input file and generate a list of tokens. The parser will read the list of tokens and generate an abstract syntax tree (AST). The AST will be used to generate the output in the form of a tree.
